Querydsl starter
============

This is a Querydsl boilerplate / helloworld project, which shows to use Querydsl (plus JPA) in Spring Boot.
Seed data and models are taken from the forked project at https://github.com/bcchapman/querydslblog.

How to import and run:

- Import the code into your editor of choice (mine is Intellij Idea Ultimate)
- Perform Maven build (Maven auto-import, then Generate sources in case of Intellij)
- Start the application as a Spring boot application as usual (run App class), Tomcat is started at port 8080 and ready to serve requests (e.g. /branch/{id})
